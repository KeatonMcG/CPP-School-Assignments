Contains completed programs for my school assignments

All assignments were coded using PuTTy and compiled with a g++ compiler

  Assignment 1 - Encrypting or Decrypting A Document

Purpose: Either encrypt or a decrypt a document. Encryption and decryption 
are performed by either a rotation method or a cryptogram method.

Input:  The user will input an encryption and decryption key for the root method while the cryptogram method requires no additional inputs.  

Output: All results of either encryption or decryption are sent to output files.

==================================================================
 
 Assignment 2 - Implementing A Dictionary

Input: The user inputs a transaction file and the program executes the instructions within the
file.  This can include things such as adding, deleting, printing, or searching for words as
well as inserting words into the dictionary.

Output: The program outputs the information retrieved and processed by the functions created in the Dictionary.cpp file

==================================================================
 
 Assignment 3 - Design and Manage A University

Purpose: Design a program that resembles a small university to demonstrate the use of inheritance.

Inputs: The user gives the program a transaction file to process, the program does not prompt the user for any values.

Outputs: The program outputs the information retrieved and processed by the functions created in the University.cpp file

==================================================================

Purpose: Design a program that creates a directory of families
and places them into a link list.

Inputs: The user gives the program a transaction file to process,
the program does not prompt the user for any additional inputs.

Outputs: The program outputs the information retrieved and
